### About the project

The project is a mobile app built using Flutter that provides users with a list of job titles to
choose from. Once the user selects a job title, the app generates job-specific prompts for the user
to copy and paste into ChatGPT, a natural language processing model. The user can then view the
responses generated by ChatGPT, which emulate the behavior and characteristics of the specified
worker. The app is designed to be simple and intuitive, providing users with an easy way to learn
about different types of jobs and their
characteristics. [Click Here](https://github.com/vijaykarthiktk/Chat-GPTPrompt).

This project has been built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework, which allows to
build an app for mobile, desktop & web, from a single codebase.
